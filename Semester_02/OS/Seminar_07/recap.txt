2. regex that matches a line of length multiple of 5 + 2

3. give the operations in shell that check if
a) a file exists -> -f
b) a directory exists -> -d
c) a file is readable -> -r
d) a string is empty -> -z
e) argument is a regular file -> -f
f) is different from a string -> -ne

    echo "file exists"
fi

4. what is the difference between $* and $@ in shell?
-> $* is a single string with all the arguments separated by the first character of IFS
-> $@ is a list of strings, each string is an argument

4. how would you restore the value of a file descriptor that was overwritten by dup2?
-> use dup to store the original file descriptor
-> dup2 returns the new file descriptor, so you can store it in a variable and use it to restore the original file descriptor

5. what is the max number of child proc that are created?

for (int i =0; i<8; ++i) {
    if (fork() == 0) {
        sleep(rand()%10);
        exit(0);
    }
    if (i%3==0) {
        wait(0);
    }
}

wait(0)
wait(0)

-> 5

0,3,6 wait, and only 1,2,4,5,7 are left

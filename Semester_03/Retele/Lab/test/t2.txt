===Jumbled Word Game===
Description: The server picks a random word, jumbles the letters, and sends it to all clients. Clients have to guess the original word.
Twist: The server sometimes sends an impossible jumble that can't be solved. If clients notice and complain, they get bonus points.
Challenge: Keep track of client guesses and handle scoring fairly despite the occasional trick.

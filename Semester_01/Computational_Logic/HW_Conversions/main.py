    Main function of the program

    Problem statement:

    Optional homework – implementation operations + conversions

    Implements:
    - arithmetic operations for positive integers: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division by one digit, in a base p in {2,3,...,9,10,16}

    - conversions of natural numbers between two bases p,q in {2,3,...,9,10,16} using the substitution method or successive divisions and rapid conversions between two bases p,q in{2, 4, 8, 16}.

    and must have a menu such that all operations and conversion methods to be verified separately.

    The executable form, the code of the application and the documentation will be submitted in the corresponding assignment on Teams. The documentation will follow the same structure as the Programming Fundament’s documentations, and it must contain at least: the problem statement for the implemented application, the used algorithms in pseudo-code, implementation considerations and test data.

    The grade is computed as follows:

    10%: by default

    70% : the application (the authors name will be found in code and will be visible at run time too)

    1p - algorithm for the method of successive divisions

    1p - algorithm for the substitution method

    1p – algorithm for conversion using 10 as an intermediate base

    2p - rapid conversions (executable form) between two bases p,qÎ{2, 4, 8, 16}.

    1p addition of two numbers in a base

    1p subtraction of two numbers in a base

    1p multiplication of a number by a digit in a base

    1p division of a number by a digit in a base

    1p code quality (indentation, use of comments, suggestive variables names)

    20%: documentation

    1p problem statement

    1p sub-algorithm’s diagram

    1p used data type specification

    3p specification and pseudo-code for the important algorithms used (input, output, preconditions, post-conditions -1p; pseudo-code 2p)

    3p at least a set of test data for the complete application, more data sets where is needed
